            <h2>About The Website</h2>
                velosophy.org.uk was created in 2025 to bring an more acadeimc perspective to everything automobile related.    
            <h2>About Alex</h2>
                <p>Alex is a fully UK-licensed Category B driver with a flawless record—having passed the practical driving test on the first attempt with zero faults and making only one error on the entire theory test.</p>
               <p> Less than a year later, Alex achieved a ‘First’ on the IAM RoadSmart Advanced Driving Test, this is a distinction that requires near perfect performance during a 40 minute evaluation conducted by an ex-police examiner.</p>
                <p>Just over a year after that, Alex earned the IAM Master Driver qualification. This award followed a demanding 90-minute assessment conducted on unfamiliar roads in a county never previously visited. The examiner, an IAM Area Service Delivery Manager and former Roads Policing officer with 40 years of experience, wrote in the final report:
                “Alex has done remarkably well to achieve this result in such a short driving career and drive with a mature attitude to safety and legality. There is an element of natural ability present in Alex’s driving […] Alex is clearly the thinking driver.”</p>
